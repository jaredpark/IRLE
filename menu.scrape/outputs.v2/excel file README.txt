Column details:

The column labeled 'menu' contains the entry 'menu' if the restuarant has only one menu. The 
column will contain 'lunch', 'dinner', etc. for restaurants that have multiple menus, while
in the case of multiple menus the column will contain 'menu' for whichever of the multiple
menus that the restaurant decided to list as the primary menu.

The column labeled 'category' is the text that would appear above the menu items on the menu,
such as 'appetizers' or 'drinks'.

The column labeled 'price' contains the price of an item if the price is listed as a single
number. If the price is listed as a range (for example, "$8.99 - $20.99" for pizza prices) the
column will contain 'NA'.

The columns labeled 'low' and 'high' contain 'NA' if the price of an item is listed as a
single number. The columns contain the corresponding low and high prices of the range listed
for items that are listed with a range of prices (such as '8.99' and '20.99' for listed price
range of "$8.99 - $20.99").
